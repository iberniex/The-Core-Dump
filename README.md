# The Core Dump

> _To confuse your enemy, first confuse self_ ~ **The Art of War - Sun Tzu**

## Intro

This is a Segfault Sanctuary, where my segmentation faults find refuge before being debugged.

Contains some Computer Science related topics such as reverse engineering, programming and cyber-security notes that I've made from various sources.

Please feel free to critique and also contribute if you want but creating an [issue](https://github.com/bernie-haxx/The-Core-Dump/issues/).

This is a progressive learning experience and just using this repository to store these findings.
CAUTION: it may not be perfect (reread for the people in the back).
